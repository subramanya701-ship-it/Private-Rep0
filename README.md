**Overview of the Approach
**
This solution is designed to implement a Personalized SMS Campaign Architecture for Abandoned Cart Recovery. The architecture integrates SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP CPI, SAP CDC, BlueConic, Dynamic Yield, and Iterable, along with an SMS delivery partner (Twilio, Sinch, etc.). 

**It focuses on:
**
Detecting abandoned carts in SAP Commerce Cloud.
Ensuring GDPR/CCPA-compliant SMS consent validation using SAP CDC.
Enriching customer profiles with behavioral data through BlueConic.
Generating personalized cart recovery content using Dynamic Yield.
Orchestrating SMS workflows using Iterable, leveraging personalized content and fallback error-handling mechanisms.
The goal is to achieve higher cart recovery rates by delivering tailored SMS reminders at the right time, driven by real-time integration and personalization.
